### Generate l10n files

**Development process**

* Developer modify `ods_flutter_en.arb` and/or `ods_flutter_fr.arb`
* In order to have the translations in the app launched locally, `flutter gen-l10n` must be launched in the `lib` directory
    * It will regenerate:
        * `ods_flutter_localizations.dart`
        * `ods_flutter_localizations_en.dart`
        * `ods_flutter_localizations_fr.dart`
* Those 3 files need **must not be** committed and pushed

**Release the library**

* Pre-step: run `flutter gen-l10n` before creating and publishing the package to generate `ods_flutter_localizations*.dart`
